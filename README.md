Electricity Demand and Price Forecasting using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast electricity demand and prices. The model uses historical data on electricity demand, prices, and weather to make predictions.
The increasing demand for electricity and the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid have created a need for accurate forecasting of electricity demand and prices. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast electricity demand and prices using historical data on electricity demand, prices, and weather.
The project focuses on short-term forecasting, predicting electricity demand and prices for the next hour, day, and week. The model is trained on a dataset that includes:
- Historical electricity demand data
- Historical electricity price data
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed)
- Calendar data (day of the week, month, holiday indicators)
The machine learning model is chosen for its ability to learn complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions. The model is trained using a combination of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.
The project has the following objectives:
1. Develop a machine learning model to forecast electricity demand and prices
2. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared
3. Compare the performance of the machine learning model with other forecasting methods
4. Analyze the feature importance and partial dependence plots to understand the relationships between the variables and the target variable
5. Deploy the model in a production-ready environment for real-time forecasting

**key goals:**
Enhanced Demand Prediction: Predicting demand with high accuracy to assist grid operators in planning and distribution, ultimately reducing the risk of power shortages and outages. Price Forecasting: Anticipating price changes to help consumers, producers, and other market participants make informed purchasing and selling decisions. Comprehensive Data Analysis: Analyzing correlations between demand, price, and external factors (such as weather and economic indicators) to uncover insights that support strategic energy planning.

**Key Outcomes:**
Improved Demand Forecasting: Accurate forecasting of electricity demand supports grid operators in allocating resources efficiently. Enhanced Price Prediction: Predicting price fluctuations empowers stakeholders in the energy market to make informed financial and operational decisions. Data-Driven Insights: This project reveals relationships between energy demand, price, and various external influences, aiding long-term planning and policy-making for sustainable energy use.
**Technical Scope**:
The project includes modules for data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series modeling, multivariate dynamic regression, and model evaluation and selection. These steps culminate in generating reliable forecasts for both demand and price, providing actionable insights for real-time decision-making and strategic energy management.

This project holds potential value for stakeholders in the energy sector, such as utility companies, market operators, and policymakers, who are increasingly relying on data-driven solutions to tackle the challenges of modern energy systems.
